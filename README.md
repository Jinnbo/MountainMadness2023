TransliterationLlama is Discord bot that has a fun and interactive take on language translation. It's feature uses the state of the art AI technology to randomly generate user input and translate it into emojis. This game challenges the users to guess the original random string. It's an entertaining way to challenge the user to guess what the original string might be. The second feature of this bot is to generate a drawing based on the user's input. These two features are related to the theme because it shows the different ways an AI can get lost in translation, and have their own interpretation on what words mean.
